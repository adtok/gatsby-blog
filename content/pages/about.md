Thank you for visiting my blog. My name is Adam, I'm currently working as a software engineer at [Clinc](https://www.clinc.com/). I'm hoping to use this blog as a space to share what I'm learning and keep notes I might find interesting easy to access and share.

Topics I plan writing about:
* Machine learning
* Mathematics
* Web development
* Productivity

Here's some other information you might want to know about me:
* I went to school at Central Michigan University, and graduated with a degree in Mathematics and Computer Science.
* My favorite subject within math is topology. I was exposed to it toward the end of my time in undergrad, and would love to explore it more.
* Most of my programming is done in Python and JavaScript/TypeScript.
* I'd like to start my own company some day.
